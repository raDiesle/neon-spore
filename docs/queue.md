# Queue

Work a session found and did not do. Every entry here is waiting for a session
of its own, and most of them drain without the owner deciding anything — the
ones that do not say so on their own line.

**What belongs here.** A refactor stepped around, a rule re-derived instead of
called, a file grown past ~250 lines, dead code, a slow path, a missing test, a
document that no longer describes the code, a tool that would have helped, and
**a command that failed and was worked around** — retried, slept past, run
twice. Working around one is what keeps it, and every later session pays the
same tax in minutes and in tokens. The test is one question: **could a fresh session finish this alone and prove it
with `bun run check`?** Yes — it goes here, in the same commit as the work that
found it, without asking first.

**A `Files:` line names files the tree already has.** `tools/test/doc-drift.test.ts`
holds every entry to it, and holds every document to naming no path in backticks
that does not exist — so a file an entry proposes to *create* is described in
the body, unbackticked, rather than listed as a file. An entry that names the
file it is about to write is red on `bun run check`.

**And a landing that could not check itself writes one, without being asked.**
`bun run land --unverified "<what>"` puts an `## Unverified at <sha>:` entry
here at the moment the trunk moves, and a cloud session uses it every time it
lands something it could not look at — a wave never watched at tempo, a shape
never seen to move, a frame cost the sandbox is too slow to take. It is an
ordinary entry: claimed, opened on a machine that can look, and removed with
`queue done`. `docs/cloud-session.md` has why the alternative — leaving it in a
report that ends with the session — was the half of that arrangement that never
worked.

**And a topic that asks the owner something belongs here too**, on an
`- **Asks:** <question>` line. That is a change the owner made on 6 September
2026, and it reverses the paragraph this file used to carry. What it fixes is
where such a thing was going instead: a question filed in `docs/spec/` is on a
page nobody opens on the way to work, so it was read the day it was written and
never again. Here it is in front of whoever runs `bun run queue`, the listing
marks it `ASKS THE OWNER`, and `next` hands the session a prompt that puts the
question first and says to build nothing until it is answered.

Such an entry is otherwise an ordinary one and is held to the same test — it is
claimed, worked in its own lane and removed by `queue done` — so the body still
has to say what to change and still has to **name the options the answer picks
between**. "What should this look like?" is not an entry. "Three places it
could be drawn, and here is what each costs" is.

**And nowhere else.** Not the report, which scrolls away — the next session
clones `origin` and sees only files. Not a suggested background task either:
this file *is* the mechanism, and a chip is a popup the owner has to dismiss
that says nothing `bun run queue` does not already say to whoever asks it. A
finding written here is read by every session that comes after; a finding
offered as a chip is read once, by the one person the queue exists to spare.

**What still does not.** A thing the game could be — a creature, a mechanic, a
control, a weapon, a boss, a round — goes in `docs/spec/`, where the director's
`◇ NOT BUILT YET` sheet reads it next to the built things it would sit beside.
A *look* with a shipped alternative is offered in `tools/versus/`, because the
only way to choose between two is to see both.

The line between those and an `Asks:` entry is **whether there is work waiting
on the answer**. A creature nobody has built is a page in the spec: there is no
lane held up by it, and the owner picks from that sheet when he opens a session
to. A control that is drawn but says the wrong word is an entry here: the work
is decided, sized and sitting in named files, and the only thing missing is one
sentence from him. Filing the first kind here is what buried the queue last
time under sixty-two entries nobody could face, and that has not stopped being
true — the new rule widens the door by one hinge, not off them.

**Every path an entry names is a path the tree has**, on the `Files:` line and
in the body alike — `tools/test/doc-drift.test.ts` holds both, and it is the
same rule every document here obeys. So an entry that proposes a **new** file
cannot spell it out: name the directory on `Files:` and call the file *a
`sheet.ts` beside `crop.ts`* in the body. A path that goes red is a document
naming something nobody can open.

**Draining it.** `bun run queue` lists what is waiting, half-done work from
`docs/parked.md` first, and says which items somebody is already on. **It also
says when an entry has gone stale** — a file its `Files:` line names was
changed on `main` by a commit dated after the entry, or is not on `main` any
more — with the commit's sha and subject, so the session that claims it
re-reads before it works; the entry itself is left as it was.
`bun run queue next` *hands out* the first free one: it creates that item's
branch, writes a `Taken:` line into the entry on `main` and pushes it, then
prints a prompt naming the branch. The session checks that branch out in its own
worktree, does the item, removes the entry with `bun run queue done <n|title>`,
and lands; the entry goes and the branch goes with it, which releases the item
at the moment the work reaches `main`. If a handed-out item is never started,
`bun run queue release <n|title>` gives it back — the line comes off `main` and
the branch is deleted.

**Marking one ongoing without opening a lane.** A session already in a worktree
that picks an item up itself — draining several in one sitting, rather than
being handed one — says `bun run queue take <n|title>`. That makes the same
claim `next` would have made, branch and `Taken:` line both, and stops there: no
prompt, no worktree. `bun run queue done` drops the claim along with the entry,
so an item stops reading as ongoing at the moment it stops being in the file.

**Is anything still being worked on.** `bun run queue status` answers in one
word — `DONE` when nothing is left at all, `IDLE` when items are waiting and
nobody is on one, `BUSY` when somebody is, naming the items and the branches
holding them. It exists to be asked of a machine that is about to be turned
off: "is the queue finished" is a question about claims, not about whether the
last command printed something.

**A claim is written twice, because neither half reaches everybody.** The branch
is the gate: worktrees of one repository share their refs, so `claude/queue-…`
is visible to the next `bun run queue` with no commit and no push, and two
sessions cannot be handed the same item because the second `git branch` fails.
The `Taken:` line is the half a local ref cannot do — a session working in its
own clone sees only what `origin` carries, and on 3 September 2026 two sessions
did the same six items in parallel for exactly that reason. So the line is
committed straight to `main` and pushed, where it is the first thing anybody
reads. `next` then moves the branch onto that commit, so a lane starts from a
trunk that already carries its own mark and its `queue done` removes the whole
entry without a conflict.

A clone with nothing on `main` — every cloud session, where the one checkout
stands on the lane and the trunk is a ref beside it — gets the same line by a
different route: the commit is written onto the ref directly, without a
checkout, and the lane's own working tree is not touched. The one thing a
claim still cannot do is said out loud rather than guessed at: if the trunk's
copy of this file has uncommitted changes in it, the branch is made and a `⚑`
line says the entry went unmarked.

An entry that is not on `main` yet — the owner asked for it to be queued and
worked in the same sitting, so it is in the lane's working tree and nowhere
else — is marked where it is: the branch is made, the line goes into the
working copy, and the lane commits it with the work that queued it. And a
claim that fails between the branch and the line takes the branch back down
with it, so the next `take` starts from nothing rather than from a ghost
that says the item is already taken.

A claim carries no commits, so it points at `main` and reads as fully merged.
`bun run land` sweeps merged branches, and for one day it swept other lanes'
claims along with its own — both sessions running on 3 September 2026 lost every
claim they held and then did the same item twice. `partitionMerged` in
`tools/land/claims.ts` now leaves a claim standing unless it is the branch being
landed, which is the one case where deleting it is the release.

**The format**, one `##` per item, and both fields are required because the
session that picks it up has read nothing else:

```
## One line saying what to change

- **Found:** 2026-09-03, claude/some-lane
- **Files:** `packages/sim/src/step.ts`, `packages/sim/test/step.test.ts`

What is wrong, what to do about it, and anything the code does not already
say. Written for somebody who was not there.
```

`- **Taken:** 2026-09-04, claude/queue-one-line-saying-what` sits between the
two while somebody is on it. Nobody writes or deletes it by hand:
`bun run queue next` puts it there and `release` or `done` takes it away, and an
entry that already has one is refused rather than overwritten.

`- **Asks:** <question>` is the fourth line, and it is the only one a finder
writes on purpose. It goes under `Files:`, it has to end in a question mark —
the parser refuses one that does not, because an `Asks:` reading like a task is
a line the owner agrees with and still cannot answer — and it makes the listing
say `ASKS THE OWNER`. **The title does not say it too**, any more than a
`Where:` entry's title says `LOCAL ONLY`: the listing hangs both off the
fields, and a title that shouts one carries it twice — into the string `take`,
`release` and `done` are matched on. The parser refuses that as well. Write the
question so it can be answered in a sentence, and let the body carry the
options it picks between:

```
## A button says two words where a sentence was asked for

- **Found:** 2026-09-06, claude/some-lane
- **Files:** `packages/content/src/controls.ts`
- **Asks:** Leave the two words, hang a caption over the band, or widen the lobe?

Why the short label is what fits today, and what each of the three costs.
```

`- **Where:** cloud` or `- **Where:** local` reserves an entry for one kind of
session, and it is the owner's line rather than the finder's. He asked for it
on 13 September 2026, the day a local session re-watched four waves a cloud
session had built: some work can only be done on a machine with a screen and a
real frame budget — a wave watched at tempo, a `bun run perf` — and some he
wants handed to a cloud session on purpose, from his phone, so the session on
his own machine stays free. The listing marks such an entry `CLOUD ONLY` or
`LOCAL ONLY`, `bun run queue next` passes over one kept for the other kind,
and `next <n>` or `take <n>` naming it is refused with the reason. A session
knows which kind it is by `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE`, the signal the web image sets
(`tools/queue/where.ts`). Without the line an entry is anybody's, which is
still what nearly every entry is.

`tools/queue/test/queue.test.ts` holds that format and fails on an entry a cold
session could not act on; `tools/queue/test/taken.test.ts` holds the claim;
`tools/queue/test/where.test.ts` holds the reservation.

## THE SCOUT's second arena leaves the scout nowhere to stop

- **Found:** 2026-09-17, claude/queue-unverified-at-ce8a2324-the-scouts-arenas-were-ne
- **Files:** `packages/content/src/scout-arenas.ts`, `packages/sim/src/config-scout.ts`
- **Asks:** Widen the column's pitch, cut the hazard's touch, or say a mote here is passed and never waited on?
- **Answered:** 17 September 2026 — move the two hazards. **The answer was given against a wrong option and does not fix this**, so the `Asks:` above replaces it with the three the geometry actually allows.

Five of the second arena's six motes sit exactly one tile from a hazard's row
— motes on rows 8.5, 6.5, 4.5 and 2.5 against hazards on 7.5 and 3.5 — and a
touch reaches `scoutRadiusMilli + scoutHazardRadiusMilli`, which is 0.88 of a
tile. So a scout parked on any of the five has 0.12 of a tile of room when the
hazard sweeps underneath it, and a scout coasting on to one has none: rows are
not remapped, so those figures are the shipped ones on any field.

The first arena has 2.12 tiles of room on every mote, which is what the
difference looks like. An autopilot that points, burns and coasts cleared the
first arena eight times out of eight when it waited hazards out, and the second
none out of eight — it is caught on the approach every time, at every one of
the eight beats it was started on. That is not proof a pair cannot fly it,
because a pair crosses between sweeps rather than stopping on the mote; it is
proof that *stopping on a mote is never safe here*, which is the one thing the
arena's own comment assumes when it says the column of motes is the line a
ship takes on its own.

The options as first written were: move the five motes half a tile off the
hazards' rows; move the two hazards to rows nothing is on — 9.5 and 5.5 are
free; or cut `scoutHazardRadiusMilli` from 460. The owner picked the second on
17 September 2026, and **the second is a no-op**. The motes sit two tiles
apart, so every row between two of them is 1.0 from one of them: 9.5 is 1.0
from the motes on 10.5 and 8.5, and 5.5 is 1.0 from those on 6.5 and 4.5 —
exactly what 7.5 and 3.5 already are. The rows the hazards are on now were
already rows nothing is on. Nothing moves.

**What the geometry actually allows.** With the column on a two-tile pitch,
1.0 of separation is the most any hazard row can have, so 0.12 of a tile is the
ceiling and not the accident. Room comes from one of three places and no other:
widen the column's pitch (2.5 tiles puts a hazard 1.25 away, which is 0.37 of
room); cut `scoutHazardRadiusMilli` (300 gives 0.28, 200 gives 0.38); or leave
the geometry and change the *comment*, which is the option nobody listed — the
arena's own text already says the column is the line a ship takes and that the
timing is the whole of it, so "a mote here is passed through and never waited
on" may be the arena as designed rather than a defect in it. Arena one's 2.12
tiles are what a mote you may park on looks like; arena two may simply not have
those, on purpose. Measured by flying the shipped
arenas in `tools/probe/`; nothing here was watched, because nothing of the
round is drawn yet (`docs/spec/interludes.md`).

**This entry now also owns the second arena's clock.** Arena one's was brought
from 40 to 18 on 17 September 2026 against a measured twelve-beat flight
(`packages/content/test/scout-flight.test.ts`), and the owner's 24 for arena
two was set aside because the autopilot has never cleared arena two to measure
it — which is the geometry above. Whoever answers the `Asks:` fixes the
geometry, points the same rig at arena one's sibling, and takes the clock from
what it measures; 56 stands until then.

## Act seven has no room for another wave and no letter to put a page under

- **Found:** 2026-09-17, claude/task-queue-progress-abb7a3
- **Files:** `packages/content/src/waves/act-7c.ts`, `packages/content/src/waves/act-7d.ts`, `packages/content/src/waves/act-7e.ts`, `packages/content/src/waves.ts`
- **Asks:** When a page in the middle splits, do the later letters shift up, or do waves migrate between pages?

`act-7c.ts` is at 248 lines of 250 and `act-7d.ts` at 247. `act-7e.ts` has 98,
so act seven holds 593 lines against a budget of 750 across its three pages:
**157 lines of headroom for twenty-two waves, and the act is still growing** —
THE HIVE's look is parked in this same file and act seven is where every new
boss has landed for a week.

Shuffling does not make headroom, it moves it. The convention the pages were
built on is that a full page is cut at its *end* and the overflow takes the
next letter, which is how `7d` came off `7c` and `7e` off `7d`. That works
until the page that fills is not the last one, and `7c` is not: the overflow
belongs between `7c` and `7d` and there is no letter there. The order of the
waves is the order of the game (`waves.ts` spreads the pages in sequence), so
the new page cannot simply go on the end.

The options the answer picks between. **Shift the letters**: cut `7c`'s tail
into a new `7d` and rename the present `7d` and `7e` to `7e` and `7f`, which
keeps every page readable as a page and costs a rename each time a middle page
fills. **Migrate waves down the chain**: move `7c`'s tail to the front of `7d`
and `7d`'s tail to the front of `7e`, which needs no rename and no new file,
but moves each wave's prose to a different page's header and buys `7c` about
55 lines while leaving `7e` near 220 — it postpones rather than solves.
**Or lift the prose**: the three headers are 46, 65 and 40 lines of design
argument, and moving that to `docs/spec/` would free more than either, at the
cost of separating a wave's reasoning from its figures — which is the thing
these headers were written the way they are to avoid.

The first is the only one that gives act seven somewhere to grow. It wants
deciding before the next boss lands rather than during it.

## `names.test.ts` times out under the full check's fifteen shards

- **Found:** 2026-09-17, claude/versus-page-pod-husk-tell-1f227a
- **Files:** `apps/server/test/names.test.ts`, `apps/server/test/relay.ts`, `tools/check/shard.ts`

`bun run land` went red on shard 8 of 15: every one of the fourteen tests in
`names.test.ts` hit the 5000 ms default timeout, with a diff that touched
nothing under `apps/server`. Run alone the file passes in under a second. The
file raises a real workerd through `relay.ts` before its first test, and
under fifteen shards on one machine that raise takes longer than a test is
allowed — so the timeout is on the first `dispatchFetch`, and every test after
it inherits the wait. The lane worked around it by running `land` a second
time, which is the tax this entry exists to stop. Either give the file (and
`room.test.ts`, which raises a workerd the same way) a timeout that covers a
cold workerd under load, or have `tools/check/shard.ts` keep the two
workerd files off a shard that carries anything else.

## `versus drop` cannot run while a function is being taken by hand

- **Found:** 2026-09-17, claude/fervent-nash-e1e7ff
- **Files:** `tools/versus/decide.ts`, `tools/versus/run.ts`, `tools/versus/test/registry.test.ts`

`drop` imports the registry, which imports every candidate in the slot, before
it removes any of them. The by-hand path `adopt` prints when it refuses a
function — move the paint, rewrite the record, delete what nothing reads, then
`drop` — leaves the tree in exactly the state that import fails in: the moved
`paint.js` is gone from the candidate, and the shipped module it took from
has lost the exports the *other* candidates in the slot were composing
(`plates` out of `lost-shutters.ts`, 17 September 2026). Taking `lost:screen`
/ `shut` hit both, and ran `drop` against the shipped file restored for the
length of the command. `drop` reads nothing off a candidate but its
`sentence` and `name`, which the directory names already carry; derive the
slot's candidates from the directories the way `index` does, or `git show
HEAD:` the registry's inputs, so the by-hand sequence the tool itself
prescribes can end in the tool. A test: move a candidate's paint out, run
`drop`, expect the slot gone.
