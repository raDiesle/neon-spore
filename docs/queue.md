# Queue

The ordered work an unattended run walks. First in the file is next to be done.

It is not the outstanding list — `bun run checks` derives that from the
`Check:` trailers, and every row of it is an obligation somebody incurred by
landing something. It is not `docs/parked.md` either, which is ideas nobody
has decided on. This is the middle one: **decided, not yet done**.

An entry leaves by being **deleted**, once its branch is on `main`. Nothing
here is ticked, and nothing here records progress — a lane is done when its
branch is an ancestor of the trunk, which git can be asked and a file cannot.
`bun run burn` asks. `docs/autonomous.md` has the rest.

**Every entry says who wanted it, on its own line under the branch.** Either
**Asked for by the owner.** or **Proposed by the run.**, those two words and no
third option — a run that has read a spec file and found a gap is proposing,
however obvious the gap. That label is the first sort key: the owner asks are
worked before anything the run thought of, and a new entry that cannot honestly
carry the first label is filed below every entry that can.

The label is not a ranking of quality. Several of the proposed entries below
are better ideas than the reports above them, and that is exactly why the
labelling exists — designing is more enjoyable than fixing, so work the run
invented rises on its own unless something holds it down.

**A lane may not change what the game already draws.** CLAUDE.md's *A look is
offered, never replaced* binds every entry in this file: a new colour, a new
animation or a different shape is written as an alternative on the NOT BUILT
YET pages, beside the shipped one, and the owner decides by looking. A brief
that would replace a look outright is a brief that has been written wrong, and
the three narrow exemptions are named there rather than here.

**What the owner asked for outranks what a run decided to do next.** The
order is not a judgement about which work is better; it is about where the
work came from. A brief that can point at something the owner said — *CILIA is
slow*, *shadow and light in the game*, *I cannot tell what combines with what*
— goes above one derived from a spec file, a `--candidates` sweep or a session
noticing a gap while it was passing. Both are legitimate work and the second
kind is often the more interesting, which is exactly why it drifts to the top
on its own if nothing holds it down.

So a run refilling this file sorts on that first and on everything else
second, and a new entry that cannot name an owner ask is filed below every one
that can, however obvious it feels while writing it. A lane whose brief does
not say where it came from is a lane nobody can sort later.

The italic line under each heading is `branch · the paths that lane owns`. Two
lanes may not own the same path. The files everything wants — `config.ts`,
`world.ts`, `canvas2d.ts`, `apps/game/src/main.ts` — are owned by nobody: add
to one in a single contiguous region and expect to replay over somebody else.
**The seven `burn-skin-*` lanes below are one block and they are first.** The
owner asked for richer looks — more skins, more animation, offered *beside*
the ones the catalogue already has rather than replacing them. They all draw
on the NOT BUILT YET → SHAPES cards in the director and **none of them touches
`packages/render`**, which is the doctrine `tools/director/src/skins.ts`
already states in its own header: a card is where a look is decided before the
game learns to draw it. That is also why no lane in this block can break a
wave.

`skins/split-s0` is the enabling lane and the other six sit behind it. They
share `tools/director/src/skins/index.ts`, which is owned by nobody and gets
one line from each — a contiguous region, replayed over, exactly like
`config.ts`.

**On the reference sheets, and there are two of them on purpose.**

`docs/reference/20-surface-designs-concept.png` is the target: twenty surfaces
as they should read — fish scale, reptile armour, beetle shell, butterfly
wing, octopus, frog, snake, sea urchin, coral, nautilus, jellyfish, diatom,
dragonfly eye, lobster, starfish, perlmutt, pinecone, sand dollar,
caterpillar, spore pod. Each carries three words naming what it is made of
(*thick plates · irregular · natural*), and those words are the brief for a
skin more than the picture is.

`docs/reference/20-surface-designs.svg` is the same twenty attempted in SVG,
and **the distance between the two files is the most useful thing in either.**
The SVG version is honest about where a vector surface falls down: most of its
spheres are one uniform lattice tiled across a circle, with a single glow laid
over the top. The concept sheet is not tiled at all — its plates change size
across the body, thin toward the rim, catch the light individually, and break
their own pattern. Compare 09 CORAL in the two files: branching structure in
one, wavy stripes in the other. Or 10 NAUTILUS: a chambered spiral, against a
plain sphere with a swoosh on it.

So the failure mode has a picture now, and it is the one every lane in this
block is warned about in its own words — *one lattice at two scales* is not
two materials. A surface reads when its elements vary with position on the
body and are lit individually. That is what the light lane exists for, and it
is why a pattern lane that composes `litPass` will beat one that does not.

Neither file is art to copy in: a fixed illustration cannot wrap a contour
re-sampled from `contourAt` every frame, so every skin here is generated in
contour space or it slides off its body within a second. The owner also linked
three svgrepo files as further reference. **No lane fetches a URL and no lane
vendors a third-party file** — that carries a licence, which is the owner's
call and not a lane's.
