 * Act two: the first six bosses, back to back, nothing else. `waves.ts` is
 * the barrel that concatenates this with the other acts — see it for why the
 * list was split by act in the first place.
 *
 * THE FLEET is the sixth and it arrived here rather than in act three, where
 * THE VANE sits among the mechanics: act three was full (`limits.test.ts`),
 * and this is the act whose whole content is bosses back to back. A seventh
 * that does not fit gets a fourth act beside act three, not a line in the
 * limits table.
