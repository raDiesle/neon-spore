/**
 * The sounds wired up with nothing to draw, the third page — from THE GAUGE
 * on.
 *
 * Cut off `sound-link-none-b.ts` on 19 September 2026, when THE SCUTTLE's
 * swing would have put that page over its 250-line limit, exactly as that
 * page was cut off the first and along the same seam: the *last* boss on the
 * full page goes across, never the boss being worked on, whose rows stay
 * under the comment that explains them. `sound-link-none.ts` spreads all
 * three into `NO_SUBJECT`, so `test/sound-link.test.ts` reads one table and
 * nothing that asks it knows there are three pages.
 *
 * THE GAUGE's four came over whole. They share one answer with the interlude
 * rows on page one: the subject is a dial and a band on a plate, and the
 * round has thrown the field away altogether — the sheet's cards are
 * silhouettes of bodies on a grid, and there is no grid here to stand on.
